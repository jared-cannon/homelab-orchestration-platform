# Homelab Orchestration Platform

Unified multi-node orchestration for homelab infrastructure. Manages distributed systems (Raspberry Pis, servers, NAS) as a single cohesive platform.

## Overview

Multi-device homelab orchestration with intelligent resource management and automated deployment.

**Key capabilities:**
1. Automatic device analysis (RAM, storage, CPU)
2. Intelligent placement decisions
3. Resource sharing (shared database instances, auto-provisioning)
4. Zero-configuration deployment

**Differentiators:**
- Multi-node orchestration (unified resource management)
- Intelligent placement (automatic device selection)
- Resource sharing (database pooling, shared caching)
- Infrastructure-aware monitoring (aggregate metrics across devices)
- Zero-configuration deployment

**Features:**
- Unified dashboard (aggregate resources across devices)
- Smart deployment (automatic device selection)
- Database pooling (single shared instance, 60% RAM savings)
- Cross-device monitoring
- App marketplace (20+ curated recipes)

## Technical Architecture

**Design:**

- Agentless (SSH and Docker API)
- Intelligent scheduler (resource scoring algorithm)
- Database pooling (shared instances with auto-provisioning)
- Single binary (Go backend, embedded React frontend)
- Multi-network aware (VLAN/subnet support)
- Recipe-based (docker-compose.yaml + manifest.yaml)

**Status:**
- âœ… Device discovery and management
- âœ… Recipe-based marketplace (20+ apps)
- âœ… Single-device deployment
- âœ… Real-time resource monitoring (CPU, RAM, Storage)
- âœ… Cross-device resource aggregation
- âœ… Intelligent resource scoring
- ðŸš§ Shared database infrastructure

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- Node 18+
- Make

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jared-cannon/homelab-orchestration-platform
cd homelab-orchestration-platform
make install-deps
make dev
```

Services:
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173

### Testing

```bash
make test              # All tests
make backend-test      # Backend only
```

### Building

```bash
make build            # Single binary with embedded frontend
./bin/homelab         # Run
```
