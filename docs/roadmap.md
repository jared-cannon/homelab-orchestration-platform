**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** October 2025
**Vision:** The first multi-device homelab orchestrator that automatically discovers, manages, and intelligently deploys applications across all your homelab hardware.

---

## üéØ Core Value Proposition

**What makes us different from Coolify/Runtipi/CasaOS:**

| Feature | Coolify/Runtipi | Our Platform |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Device Discovery | Manual server addition | **Automatic network scanning** |
| Multi-Device Support | Multiple servers (manual) | **Centralized multi-device orchestration** |
| Deployment Model | App-first ("deploy this app") | **Device-first ("deploy to best device")** |
| Resource Awareness | Per-server only | **Cross-device resource intelligence** |
| Topology View | Server list | **Visual homelab network map** |
| Migration | Manual backup/restore | **One-click app migration between devices** |

**Core Problem We Solve:**
> "I have 3 Raspberry Pis, 2 old laptops, and a NAS. Each has different resources. I want ONE dashboard to see everything, deploy apps to the right device automatically, and manage my entire homelab without SSH-ing into 6 different machines."

## üó∫Ô∏è Feature Roadmap

## Phase 2: Multi-Device Intelligent Deployment (Q1 2026)

**Goal:** Make deployment smart and device-aware, not just app-focused.

### 2.1 Smart Deployment Recommendations ‚≠ê UNIQUE
**Problem:** Users don't know which device is best for each app.

**Features:**
- **Resource-Based Recommendations**
  ```
  "Where should I deploy Vaultwarden?"

  ‚úÖ Recommended: NAS (8GB RAM available, always-on)
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  OK: Pi-4 (2GB RAM available, but low storage)
  ‚ùå Not Recommended: Pi-Zero (512MB RAM, app needs 1GB)
  ```

- **Deployment Scoring Algorithm**
  - RAM availability score
  - Storage availability score
  - CPU capability score
  - Device uptime/reliability score
  - Network bandwidth score (future: speed test integration)
  - Power consumption score (favor low-power for always-on apps)

- **Auto-Select Best Device**
  - Wizard defaults to highest-scoring device
  - Show reasoning: "Selected NAS because it has 8GB RAM free and is always-on"

### 2.2 Deployment Execution with Traefik
**Features:**
- Docker Compose rendering from recipe templates
- SSH-based deployment to selected device
- Traefik automatic reverse proxy setup (optional)
- Multi-network architecture (app network + proxy network)
- Health check monitoring
- Real-time deployment progress via WebSocket
- Post-deployment instructions display

### 2.3 Deployment Management
**Features:**
- List all deployments across ALL devices
- Filter by device, status, category
- Start/Stop/Restart containers remotely
- View container logs (streaming via WebSocket)
- Resource usage per deployment
- "Open App" button (proxy URL or IP:PORT)

---

## Phase 3: Homelab Topology & Visualization (Q2 2026)

**Goal:** Make the homelab feel like a unified system, not scattered devices.

### 3.1 Visual Homelab Map ‚≠ê UNIQUE
**Problem:** Users don't have a mental model of their homelab topology.

**Features:**
- **Interactive Network Topology Graph**
  - Nodes = Devices (size = resources, color = status)
  - Connections = Network links
  - Mini-cards on each device showing:
    - Device name and IP
    - CPU/RAM/Disk usage bars
    - Icons of deployed apps
    - Device temperature (if available)

- **Device Grouping**
  - Group by location (bedroom, garage, office)
  - Group by function (storage, compute, network)
  - Group by hardware type (Pi, NAS, x86)

- **Drill-Down Interaction**
  - Click device ‚Üí see all apps running on it
  - Click app ‚Üí see resource usage, logs, controls
  - Hover connection ‚Üí see network bandwidth (future)

**Example:**
```
     [Router]
        |
   +----+----+
   |    |    |
[NAS] [Pi-4] [Laptop]
  |     |      |
[App1] [App2] [App3]
[App4]
```

### 3.2 Unified Homelab Dashboard ‚≠ê UNIQUE
**Problem:** No single view of entire homelab health.

**Features:**
- **Aggregate Resource View**
  - Total RAM: 16GB (8GB used across all devices)
  - Total Storage: 2TB (500GB used across all devices)
  - Total CPU Cores: 12 (average 45% utilization)

- **Device Health Scores**
  - Green = All good (< 70% resource usage)
  - Yellow = Warning (70-90% usage)
  - Red = Critical (> 90% usage or unreachable)

- **Recent Activity Feed**
  - "Deployed Vaultwarden to NAS - 2 min ago"
  - "Pi-4 rebooted - 1 hour ago"
  - "Jellyfin container stopped on Laptop - 3 hours ago"

- **Homelab Statistics**
  - Total apps deployed: 12
  - Total devices: 5 (4 online, 1 offline)
  - Average uptime: 99.2%
  - Power consumption estimate (if supported by devices)

## Phase 4: Advanced Multi-Device Features (Q3 2026)

### 4.1 One-Click App Migration ‚≠ê UNIQUE
**Problem:** Moving an app from one device to another requires manual backup/restore.

**Features:**
- **Migration Wizard**
  ```
  Step 1: Select app to migrate
  Step 2: Select destination device
  Step 3: Validation (does destination have resources?)
  Step 4: Execute migration:
    - Export volumes from source
    - Transfer data via SSH/SCP
    - Deploy to destination with same config
    - Health check on destination
    - Optionally remove from source
  ```

- **Smart Migration Recommendations**
  - "Jellyfin is using 95% of Pi-4 RAM ‚Üí Migrate to NAS?"
  - "Database on Pi with limited storage ‚Üí Migrate to NAS?"

- **Bulk Migration**
  - "Migrate ALL apps from Pi-Zero to Pi-4"
  - Useful when upgrading/replacing hardware

### 4.2 Cross-Device Deployments ‚≠ê UNIQUE
**Problem:** Some apps need multiple components on different devices.

**Features:**
- **Multi-Device Recipes**
  ```yaml
  # recipes/nextcloud-distributed.yaml
  name: Nextcloud (Distributed)
  components:
    - name: database
      device_criteria:
        min_ram_gb: 2
        min_storage_gb: 50
        prefer: "storage-optimized"  # Deploy to NAS

    - name: web
      device_criteria:
        min_ram_gb: 1
        prefer: "always-on"  # Deploy to Pi

  networking:
    auto_link: true  # Automatically configure DB connection
  ```

- **Automatic Cross-Device Networking**
  - Configure web app with database IP automatically
  - Support WireGuard/Tailscale for secure inter-device communication
  - Handle service discovery across devices

### 4.3 Device Groups & Batch Operations ‚≠ê UNIQUE
**Problem:** Performing actions across multiple devices is tedious.

**Features:**
- **Device Group Management**
  - Create groups: "Pi Cluster", "Storage Nodes", "Edge Devices"
  - Group-level operations:
    - "Deploy monitoring to ALL devices in group"
    - "Restart Docker on ALL Pi devices"
    - "Update Traefik on ALL devices"

- **Batch Deployment**
  - "Deploy Uptime Kuma to all devices for monitoring"
  - "Deploy Traefik to all edge devices"
  - Visual progress: "Deployed 3/5 devices, Pi-Zero failed"

- **Group Dashboards**
  - See aggregate stats for device group
  - Compare performance across group members

**Features:**
- **Auto-Scaling Across Devices**
  - Detect when device is overloaded (> 90% RAM)
  - Suggest migrating least-critical app to another device
  - Optionally auto-migrate with user approval

- **Round-Robin Deployment**
  - "I want to deploy 10 instances of this app"
  - System distributes across all capable devices automatically

### 5.2 Predictive Recommendations
**Features:**
- **Usage Pattern Analysis**
  - "Jellyfin CPU spikes every evening 7-10pm"
  - "Database RAM usage growing 5% per month ‚Üí will exceed capacity in 6 months"

- **Proactive Suggestions**
  - "Pi-4 temperature consistently > 70¬∞C ‚Üí Consider adding cooling or migrating apps"
  - "NAS storage 80% full ‚Üí Suggest cleanup or expansion"

### 5.3 Disaster Recovery
**Features:**
- **Automatic Backups**
  - Schedule volume backups for all deployments
  - Cross-device backup (backup Pi apps to NAS)

- **One-Click Restore**
  - Device failed? Restore all apps to different device
  - "Pi-Zero died ‚Üí Restore all 3 apps to Pi-4"
